# Enabling Performance Tracking for GuardianHealth
Founded in 2016, GuardianHealth is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers throughout the US. In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories spanning topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. Their customers can sign up for four different plans -- bronze, silver, gold, and platinum -- each with different premiums and claim coverage rates. 

To help the marketing team at GuardianHealth **understand and evaluate the to-date performance** of the various marketing campaign categories and **strategize their marketing budget for the year**, an interactive Tableau dashboard was developed to deliver insights on the company's **key marketing and healthcare metrics**. 

A link to the interactive dashboard is [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rui.gao7453/viz/GuardianHealth/dashboard?publish=yes).
