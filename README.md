# Enabling Performance Tracking for GuardianHealth
Founded in 2016, GuardianHealth is a medical insurance company serving over thousands of customers throughout the US. In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories spanning topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. Their customers can sign up for 4 different plans - bronze, silver, gold, and platinum - each with different premiums and claim coverage rates. 

To help the marketing team at GuardianHealth understand and evaluate the to-date performance of the various marketing campaign categories and strategize their marketing budget for the upcoming year, an interactive Tableau dashboard was built to deliver insights related to key marketing and healthcare metrics.
